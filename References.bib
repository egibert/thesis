title = "SEGUE: Quality of service aware edge cloud service migration",
abstract = "Edge cloud computing moves cloud services to the edge of the network, thereby allowing clients to access services with a significantly reduced network delay. This service migration is intended to enable a range of latency sensitive mobile applications. In this paper, we propose to manage user QoS by actively migrating services to different edge clouds in response to degraded server or network performance. Previous studies have proposed a distance-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) for optimizing migration decisions. These models provide the feasibility of applying MDP to edge cloud service migration decisions. However, these models fail to consider dynamic network and server states in migration decisions. In this work, we address these limitations by designing a comprehensive edge cloud migration decision system, which we call SEGUE. SEGUE achieves optimal migration decisions by providing a long-term optimal QoS to mobile users in the presence of link quality and server load variation. The basis of SEGUE is in its QoS-aware service migration and its state based MDP model which effectively incorporates the two dominant factors in making migration decisions: 1) network state, and 2) server state. An evaluation of SEGUE performance is given through an augmented reality application. Our results demonstrate that SEGUE reduces the response time of this application by 27.21{\%} and 53.70{\%} compared to the lowest load migration model and the least hop migration model, respectively.",

abstract="Privacy-preserving billing protocols are useful in settings where a meter measures user consumption of some service, such as smart metering of utility consumption, pay-as-you-drive insurance and electronic toll collection. In such settings, service providers apply fine-grained tariff policies that require meters to provide a detailed account of user consumption. The protocols allow the user to pay to the service provider without revealing the user's consumption measurements. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a general model where a meter can output meter readings to multiple users, and where a user receives meter readings from multiple meters. Unlike previous schemes, our model accommodates a wider variety of smart metering applications. Second, we describe a protocol based on polynomial commitments that improves the efficiency of previous protocols for tariff policies that employ splines to compute the price due.",

abstract="Cloud computing is a promising computing model that enables convenient and on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. The first offered cloud service is moving data into the cloud: data owners let cloud service providers host their data on cloud servers and data consumers can access the data from the cloud servers. This new paradigm of data storage service also introduces new security challenges, because data owners and data servers have different identities and different business interests. Therefore, an independent auditing service is required to make sure that the data is correctly hosted in the Cloud. In this paper, we investigate this kind of problem and give an extensive survey of storage auditing methods in the literature. First, we give a set of requirements of the auditing protocol for data storage in cloud computing. Then, we introduce some existing auditing schemes and analyze them in terms of security and performance. Finally, some challenging issues are introduced in the design of efficient auditing protocol for data storage in cloud computing.",

abstract="This paper proposes a novel discovery framework for smart objects in the Internet of Things (IoT). The discovery service is a fundamental block of the IoT as it allows smart objects and their users to dynamically discover distributed smart objects and, specifically, the services and operations they provide. The proposed framework defines a new metadata model to describe features, services, and operations of network-enabled smart objects, and implements a service-oriented service, accessible through a REST interface, for registering, indexing, and searching smart objects. Thanks to its generic architecture and the use of open Web standards, the proposed discovery service can be easily integrated into any smart object middleware. In particular, we show its integration into an agent-based middleware supported by the JADE platform.",

abstract = {Summary Large scientific facilities provide researchers with instrumentation, data, and data products that can accelerate scientific discovery. However, increasing data volumes coupled with limited local computational power prevents researchers from taking full advantage of what these facilities can offer. Many researchers looked into using commercial and academic cyberinfrastructure (CI) to process these data. Nevertheless, there remains a disconnect between large facilities and CI that requires researchers to be actively part of the data processing cycle. The increasing complexity of CI and data scale necessitates new data delivery models, those that can autonomously integrate large-scale scientific facilities and CI to deliver real-time data and insights. In this paper, we present our initial efforts using the Ocean Observatories Initiative project as a use case. In particular, we present a subscription-based data streaming service for data delivery that leverages the Apache Kafka data streaming platform. We also show how our solution can automatically integrate large-scale facilities with CI services for automated data processing.},

abstract="In this article, we propose a new architecture for wide area sensor and actuator networking. The architecture is based on combining two protocols being standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force, REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). To integrate CoAP and RELOAD, we introduce a CoAP application usage for RELOAD. The architecture provides a decentralized peer-to-peer rendezvous service for CoAP nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Our architecture also enables a peer-to-peer federation of geographically distributed WSNs. This is supported by proxy nodes that are part of the WSN but also connect to a RELOAD overlay network via cellular Internet access. Due to the use of RELOAD, the system does not need to rely on centralized services such as DNS service discovery (DNS-SD) or central resource directories to discover sensors and resources. Other features of the architecture include integration to web, self-organization, scalability, and robustness. We evaluate the proposed architecture through simulations and real-life measurements, and compare its performance to a traditional client/server architecture.",

abstract = "A fundamental problem in large scale, decentralized distributed systems is the efficient discovery of information. This paper presents Squid, a peer-to-peer information discovery system that supports flexible searches and provides search guarantees. The fundamental concept underlying the approach is the definition of multi-dimensional information spaces and the maintenance of locality in these spaces. The key innovation is a dimensionality reducing indexing scheme that effectively maps the multi-dimensional information space to physical peers while preserving lexical locality. Squid supports complex queries containing partial keywords, wildcards and ranges. Analytical and simulation results show that Squid is scalable and efficient."
