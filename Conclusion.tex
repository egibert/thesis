\section{Conclusion}
...

This thesis identified and addressed key problems and requirements of IoT applications. Specifically, this thesis presented a programming abstraction enables to address the what, where, and when data needs to be processed by specifying content and action descriptors. In addition this thesis also tackles the how to split a given dataflow and place operators across edge and cloud resources. First, this thesis presented a modification of the Associative Rendezvous programming abstraction to allow to decide what and where data needs to be processed. Second this thesis presented a R-Pulsar an IoT Edge Framework that extends cloud capabilities to edge devices, enabling users to collect and analyze data closer to the source of the information. Third this thesis presented a rule-based programming abstraction for specifying when to trigger data-processing tasks based on data observations. Finally, this thesis presented a solution to the distributed operator placement problem for allowing to decide how to split the application operators between the edge and the cloud, by specifying a set of constraints. We evaluated the effectiveness, scalability, performance and overheads of R-Pulsar software stack by using three sets of IoT applications and validated every layer by performing scalability, overhead and performance tests.

\section{Perspectives}
The research presented in this dissertation opens several research problems that need to be addressed in order to further advance on the edge computing area.

\textbf{Energy Management:} Reducing the energy used in Cloud Computing is a well known and important issue. Powering billions of embedded edge devices will become one of the biggest challenges that IoT will faces. Deploying IoT devices for a very long time becomes the main hurdle. R-Pulsar does not have the ability to quantify the amount of energy spend or to schedule computations while being energy efficient. There is a need for tools that will give feedback on how energy efficient the code is. For those reasons energy management is a potential research direction. 

\textbf{Security and Privacy:} IoT data deals with very private and sensitive data for this reason there is a need to develop tools that offer security and privacy while being lightweight. R-Pulsar does not address any security or privacy cancers, so a possible research direction is to create algorithms that provide strong security protection, while fitting within an acceptable footprint. It needs to be lightweight enough that will still leave room for the embedded OS and applications code. 

\textbf{Edge based stream processing engines:} There is a need to develop more lightweight stream processing engine that can be deployed on constrained devices. Current stream processing engines (SPEs) such as Storm~\cite{storm}, Flink~\cite{flink}, Heron~\cite{heron} and Spark~\cite{spark} where designed to be deployed in the Cloud, with large number of clusters with powerful computing resources and plenty of memory. However, these assumptions do not hold at the Edge of the network. R-Pulsar does not offer a new SPE, it just simply uses Apache Edgent. For this reason there is a need to research a develop new SPE that are designed to run in constrained devices.
